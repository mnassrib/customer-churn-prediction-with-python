# customer-churn-prediction-with-python

Customer churn, also known as customer retention, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers.
This repository exposes some machine learning classifiers applied on data from Kaggle web site. It presents 18 classifiers that will be compared using the GridSearchCV method. In addition, it focuses on the data visualization using interactives plots.

This notebook is running on google colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mnassrib/customer-churn-prediction-with-python/blob/master/customer_churn_prediction_telecom_churn_dataset.ipynb)

Given the size of the executed code file and to make it downloadable on github, I deliberately didn't run all of the code. It seems that the interactive figures cannot be viewed directly on github. It is better to look at the file on nbviewer available on this [link] (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mnassrib/customer-churn-prediction-with-python/blob/master/customer_churn_prediction_telecom_churn_dataset.ipynb)
